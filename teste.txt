I'm Jonathan, I'm 28 years old, I've been working in the IT area for 12 years, 10 of them focused on Avaya products, where I gained a lot of knowledge and made me extremely passionate about what I do for all my experience in the telecommunications world.
I gained great experience in PABX, Contact Center and other solutions involved, becoming an expert in the area. I am communicative, easy to learn, determined and focused.
I am proficient in Portuguese and Spanish, intermediate English and my project is to take classes 4 times a week.
I'm doing a programming course in Python, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and I'm in the basic module, and I complement it with the Information Technology faculty.
Initially I intend to work from Brazil but in a year I intend to move to Utah.
I am available to participate in an initial interview or selection process.
However, I would really like to be part of Team Xima because I admire the product a lot, where you deliver several facilities adding a lot of value and performance to customers, I say this without any deception because I am a consumer of the products, I imagine that it would form a perfect date if you have this opportunity to be part of the Xima team, because with my experience and ideas added to the excellence of Xima products we can do amazing things.
